# PC-Assemble
PC assembly activity was conducted in the N28 Level 3 laboratory room on 6/11/2024 (Wed) . Students were required to worked in groups of six with the guidance of technicians who taught us the steps of disassembling a PC. Afterward, we were tasked with reassembling the PC ourselves in group.

<h2> Preparation </h2>
1.Gather Tools and Components

  -Screwdriver (typically Phillips head).
  
  -Anti-static wrist strap (optional but recommended).
  
  -All PC components:
      
      -Case
      
      -Motherboard
      
      -Processor (CPU)
      
      -CPU Cooler

</p>
      -Cables and connectors

      
2.Work in a Clean and Static-Free Area

    -Avoid carpets to prevent static electricity.
    
    -Lay out components and tools for easy access.


<h2> Step-by-Step Assembly </h2>

1. Attach the CPU Cooler
    -Mount the cooler on top of the CPU and secure it according to the cooler instructions.
    -Connect the cooler fan cable to the CPU_FAN header on the motherboard.
    
2. Install Storage
    -Mount hard disk into their respective bays.
    -Secure them with screws.
   
3. Install RAM
    -Open the RAM slots on the motherboard.
    -Align the notch on the RAM stick with the slot and press down firmly until it clicks into place.
   
4. Install the Power Supply (PSU)
    -Mount the PSU into its designated spot in the case.
    -Secure it with screws and route the cables out of the way.
   
5. Connect Power Cables
    -Connect all the necessary cables to the motherboard, hard disks, and power supply unit.
   
6. Once all the components are in place, close the PC case.
    
7.Test the System
    -Connect the PC to a monitor and check it's can start running the PC.


With the monitor successfully turning on, we confirmed our assembly was correctly finished and were the first group to complete it. Here I provide the pictures of the components :

Through this activity, I gained hands-on experience in assembling and disassembling a PC. Besides, I also developed a better understanding of each component's function, which contributes to the overall operation of a computer.
