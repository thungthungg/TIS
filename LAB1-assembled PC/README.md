# PC-Assemble
PC assembly activity was conducted in the N28 Level 3 laboratory room on 6/11/2024 (Wed) . Students were required to worked in groups of six with the guidance of technicians who taught us the steps of disassembling a PC. Afterward, we were tasked with reassembling the PC ourselves in group.
