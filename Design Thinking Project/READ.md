# DESIGN THINKING PROJECT

<h4>Our group project revolves around designing and developing an innovative Smart Retractable Canopy using Big Data, IoT (Internet of Things), and AI (Artificial Intelligence).</h4>

<h2> Project Objective </h2>

- Solve issues with traditional canopies that are static and manually controlled, particularly in handling unpredictable weather.

- Create a more flexible, user-friendly, and smart canopy to improve the living experience.

<h2> Key Features of the Smart Canopy </h2>

<h3>1. Sensors : </h3>

- Humidity, light, and temperature sensors to monitor environmental conditions.

<h3>2. Automation : </h3>

- Utilizes AI to react to weather conditions (e.g., opens during rain or heat and retracts during strong winds).

- Incorporates GPS to detect user proximity and prepare the canopy accordingly.

<h3>3. Manual Control : </h3>

- Allows users to operate the canopy for specific purposes like parties or washing cars.
