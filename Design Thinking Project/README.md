<h2> Project Objective </h2>

- Solve issues with traditional canopies that are static and manually controlled, particularly in handling unpredictable weather.🌞

- Create a more flexible, user-friendly, and smart canopy to improve the living experience.📎

<h2> Key Features of the Smart Canopy </h2>

<h3>1. Sensors : </h3>

- Humidity👧🏻, light💡, and temperature sensors❄️🌡️ to monitor environmental conditions.

<h3>2. Automation : </h3>

- Utilizes AI to react to weather conditions (e.g., opens during rain🌧️ or heat🔥 and retracts during strong winds🌪️).

- Incorporates GPS📍 to detect user proximity and prepare the canopy accordingly.

<h3>3. Manual Control : </h3>

- Allows users to operate the canopy for specific purposes like parties🎉 or washing cars.🚗

<h2> Development Process </h2>

<h3>1.Empathy : </h3>

- Identified target users (millennial homeowners with car porches) through surveys and interviews to understand their frustrations with fixed canopies.🔎

<h3>2. Problem Definition : </h3>

- Fixed canopies are inconvenient during rain or excessive heat and require manual operation.🌧️

<h3>3. Ideation : </h3>

- Conceptualized a retractable canopy inspired by roller window shades, incorporating IoT and AI for automation.

<h3>4. Prototyping : </h3>

- Created a scaled model using simple materials (e.g., cardboard) to demonstrate the working concept.⭐

<h3>5. Testing : </h3>

- Verified functionality, confirming the canopy's ability to retract and adapt to environmental conditions.✒️

<h2>Outcome </h2>

- Developed a functional prototype showcasing the concept's feasibility.

- Provided an innovative solution addressing user needs while promoting convenience, sustainability, and smart living.⌛

<h2>Team Contribution </h2>

- Each member played distinct roles, from ideation and drafting to prototype creation, video editing, and report writing. ✏️Leadership and collaboration were evident throughout the project.⏱️

<h2>Reflection </h2>

- The project emphasized practical problem-solving and leveraging technology to improve daily life.🧠

- Team members gained insights into user-centered design and the potential of IoT and AI in creating smart solutions.📌
