<h2> 1. Project Objective 📋</h2>

- Solve issues with traditional canopies that are static and manually controlled, particularly in handling unpredictable weather.
- Create a more flexible, user-friendly, and smart canopy to improve the living experience.

<h2> 2. Key Features of the Smart Canopy 🗝️</h2>

**Sensors :**
- Humidity, light, and temperature sensors🌡️ to monitor environmental conditions.

**Automation :**
- Utilizes AI to react to weather conditions (e.g., opens during rain or heat🔥 and retracts during strong winds🌪️).
- Incorporates GPS📍 to detect user proximity and prepare the canopy accordingly.

**Manual Control :**
- Allows users to operate the canopy for specific purposes like parties or washing cars.🚗

<h2> 3. Development Process ⚙️</h2>

**Empathy :**
- Identified target users (millennial homeowners with car porches) through surveys and interviews to understand their frustrations with fixed canopies.

**Problem Definition :**
- Fixed canopies are inconvenient during rain or excessive heat and require manual operation.

**Ideation :**
- Conceptualized a retractable canopy inspired by roller window shades, incorporating IoT and AI for automation.

**Prototyping :**
- Created a scaled model using simple materials (e.g., cardboard) to demonstrate the working concept.

**Testing :**
- Verified functionality, confirming the canopy's ability to retract and adapt to environmental conditions.


<h2>4. Outcome ✏️</h2>

- Developed a functional prototype showcasing the concept's feasibility.
- Provided an innovative solution addressing user needs while promoting convenience, sustainability, and smart living.⌛
