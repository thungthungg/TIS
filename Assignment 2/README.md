<h2>💡Refelction</h2>
  
The visit to UTM Digital was both enlightening and informative, offering valuable insights into its operations and services🧩. I gained a clearer understanding of UTM Digital’s background, which is overseen by its Director, Nik Kamal Izuddin Nik Ibrahim👨🏻. During the visit, I learned about services such as UTMID, which is essential for accessing WiFi and university portals, as well as the significance of using UTM emails📩. I also discovered that UTM’s WiFi📡 and wired networks were upgraded in late 2023 to improve connectivity and efficiency.

Moreover, I found out that UTM utilizes Oracle RAC 19C as its database server, ensuring secure data collection and management📋. The visit also provided an overview of the open office and Digital Unit facilities, which are integral to supporting both academic and administrative functions. However, I feel the experience could be enhanced by simplifying some of the technical explanations📎. I also look forward to exploring more areas of UTM Digital, such as the Data Center, in future visits.
